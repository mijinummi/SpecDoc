# SpecDoc
SpecDoc is an automated documentation engine that transforms smart contract ABIs and Soroban specs into interactive, Swagger-style portals. It allows developers to generate "Try-it-now" API docs directly from their code, enabling instant testing and easier integration for decentralized apps.
